Critical analysis of Indoor positioning systems via magnetic fields using Indoor Atlas.

### Magnetic fields

reviewed technology: IndoorAtlas 
Aim: to locate individuals in real time and measure the level of accuracy/lag. 

Specifics:
smart Phone: yes(Android/iOS) windows not yet tested 
Beacon: no yet
open source: no 
accuracy: 1-2 meters 

Was difficult downloading the software, sometimes didnt work on different versions of android and iOS: these include LG touch screens(IOS), smart devices(ipod, version 6), Windows tablet. 

Worked on: iphone downloaded app, was extrememly accurate when picking up the location of the iphone(1-2 m)
Information storage: still controlled by company, not easy to direct to a controlled storage system. testingwill be continued in this area. 

# summary:
useful for smartphone technology, not yet developed to the point to be quite competitiive with other IPS, however its accuracy makes it a very desirable alternative.
