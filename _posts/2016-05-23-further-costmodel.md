So for upscaling for this project, we have started to think carefully about how much it would cost to get this show on the road and implement the IPS into ARUP and BVN.

These values are based off the number of RBPi's needed to occupy the area of ARUP with 5m, 7m, and 10m increments.

# Criticisms

Still working through the possibility that the calculations are wrong, however when I tested the point location on the floor plan, in reference to real life, It was farely accurate. However, better to be safe then sorry
