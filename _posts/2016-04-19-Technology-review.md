Some notes about conducting a technology review with articles 

# Technology review 

Practical research in the form of a Technology Review will be conducted as an effort to achieve the 2) objective outlined above. There are several reasons why a technology review was chosen, a) to test product information and effectiveness over a series of different platforms, b) to identify, rank or sort products that appear suited to certain (indoor) environments, c) to help describe the products into a taxonomy that may prove useful for the current research project, future experiments or other research projects, d) to give an overview of surrounding literatures or reviews of the described product for a clear understanding of how the technology works and any issues the user may face during its experimentation or feedback from current industry users and e) to help minimize technology failures during experimentation to maximizes experimentation validity and reliability of results and ethical practice. 

MIT (MIT Technology Review , 2015) technology review (2016) describes its own review as being ‘An authoritative filter for the overwhelming flood of information about technology’. The importance of conducting a technology review in a world surrounded by a plethora of possible technologies, a system that sorts “good technology” from “bad technology” is incredibly important for a research project based on technology use. As this research project is undertaking a study intrinsic on the performance of its chosen IPS technology, testing product information against actual product results, as well as comparing the findings of the Literature review gives the researcher a good understanding about what technology works and what doesn’t. This also helps assure the reader of the reliability and validity of the research results according to (TechRadar, 2015). The technology review site explains how testing the product in a series of circumstances exposes the strengths and weaknesses of technology products. Relating the findings to surrounding literature exemplifies the issues or situational strengths of technology and helps the researcher categorize products into a helpful Taxonomy based on what products work most reliably and efficiently within a specific environment. The Australian Government Science & Research Priorities (The Australian Government, 2015)explains how “Even in the priority areas, a significant amount of the research will need to be early-stage, basic research” as not only described as “good scientific practice” but also an “ethical one”. Nils Roll-Hansen (Hanson, 2009)offers insight into how “basic research” is extremely significant for political decision making over ethical scientific practices and detailing industry standard technology uses. (Lena Dolby.2010) also exemplifies this idea, detailing a step-by-step process for carrying out a reliable technology review with a practical scientific focus that is future-oriented and aims to improve validity and reliability when conducted in a systemized way.
