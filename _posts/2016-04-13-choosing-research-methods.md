## Research Methods

For our research for indoor tracking, we can look at the main two types of research categories available and decide which are the most applicable to our situation.

- Qualitative: Describing through - interviews, surveys, and Observations
- Quantitative: Data driven - numerical and statistical explanations

Most of the existing indoor tracking research is **Quantitative**, either testing a technology or looking at patterns to understand human movement from collected data. Therefore we should be using a more practical data analysis approach and backup our methodology with theory from existing works.

### Experiment or Observation

Both are very different and require.

#### Experimental

- Apply an observation and insert a change
- Use a control variable to compare the results

#### Observation

- Monitor and view an existing environment
- Record information and make conclusions
