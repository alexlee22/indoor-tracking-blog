I ran some test on the RSSI values to test the Bluetooth reader on the Raspberry Pi's from the 2015 Hack Day. I will test with 'Stick n Find' and Estimote stickers

###BECO

|  **Distance (m)**   | **RSSI Value**   | **Fluxuation Range**   |
| 0 | 40 | +-3 |
| 0.1 | 50 | +-2 |
| 0.2 | 58 | +-3 |
| 0.5 | 63 | +-3 |
| 1 | 80 | +-3 |
| 2 | 85-90 | +-5 |
| 5 |  |  |

The RSSI is accurate around 0-1 meter distance, it then starts increasing the fluxation range.

###Stick N Find

###Estimote
