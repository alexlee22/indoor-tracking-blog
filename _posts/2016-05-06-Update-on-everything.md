Still working on this post



### update on Thesis work

Acadia paper = done!
Ethics: In the works, still writting up scenario and then filling out form to hand in on Monday the 9th of May. 
MongoDB: Still going, kinda. 


important life questions:

1) You were talking yesterday about there being a chance of not being picked up by the RPi on a particular cycle of broadcast.
a) What is the likelihood that this will happen? Is it every other time, 1 in 10, 1 in 100? We need to know this.
b) given average walking speed, and the likelihood of missing a detection cycle, would a person walk through the entire range without being picked up?

2) Can someone write a post on:
a) The estimote sticker. What is its range, how does it behave if it's moving vs still, what's in it's broadcast packet, what does that mean  etc.
b) how to get an offline dev environment working (Annisa, I'm looking at you here)

3) Data volume
a) we need to know what data comes off the sensors. I'm guessing you'll have rssi, datetime, beacon id, base station id. What else is there?
b) in an ideal world, how often are we recording this?
c) if we multiply these things out, how much data is that per unit of time. E.g. it's 50000 recordings per day which means 10mb of data
