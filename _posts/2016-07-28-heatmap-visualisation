### Data Visualisation Concept

My research involves looking at how people utilise the space with indoor tracking data. It becomes incredibilly hard to understand how people use a space without being a stalker looking over their shoulder 24/7. Not to mension its impossible to personally monitor 100 people constantly throughout the day. An indoor positioing tool can help simplify the problem by peridocially and passivley monitoring their approximate location within a space. While we cannot understand exactly what they are doing, we can make assumptions based on the scenario and small observations.

I aim to use stastical analysis is to assist in understanding what areas are used and what affect does that particualr area have on individuals. A heatmap is envisioned for a visually and easy comparrison of diffrent spaces. Individual designed areas will aslo be looked at with hotdesking environments. There are endless possibilitiied for understanding how people use the space with tracking data, however how will this be executed. Heres some [examples](http://dataspaces.truthlabs.com/) that Anniza found.

I have used Processing in the past for quick, easy and greate visualisitons. However the limitations of processing made me go look for other alternatives. My next goal was to find a suitable representation tool for my thesis to display the results I want.

### Processing

[Processing](http://processing.org/) is an easy visualisation tool originally based on Java (includes Python) that uses a visual libary to help represent programing language by using shapes and colours. Commonly used for interaction and visualisation purposes within architecture, processing is an easy representation tool which is commonly delivered as a run `.exe` package.

Processing however does not let you deploy the package as a web or easy access application, making the level of accessability quite low. It would become very hard to generate the visuals with live data. It is much better for low to medium level programing and especially works well with hardcoded data. The style in processing is quite similar to JavaScript (as most programing languages) so I decided to look for some JavaScript libaries.

### D3.js Javascript

[Data-Driven Documents](https://d3js.org/) allows creation of data visualisation using JavaScript and D3 libary. Simillary to processing, it is a visual libary which allows use to use new functions that is quite similar. It can be used to generate graphs, tables or diagrams which all are impacted by an automated data style.

Best of all, it can possibly be merged with the current server which can open possibilities for a smooth new server. The dream would be to get the visualisation working in realtime, but one step at a time.
