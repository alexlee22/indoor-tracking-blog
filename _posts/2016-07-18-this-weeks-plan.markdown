So we split up the to-do list. 

1. Coming from the script that was originally used to do the first isovist model, planning to do the same but positioning the base stations in places that are more feasable for deployment at both bvn and arup. So this may or may not mean it will require more base stations than what was planned out [here](http://where-in.space/2016/bvn-and-arup-isovist). Also to make note that the linked post shouldn't of been taken as where it was suppose to be but rather just a rough set out as part of a separate visualisation.

At BVN it would be great to position the base stations on the ceiling cable trays - it will be clean, efficient etc. I couldn't find more than a sketchup model of the office, so might need to do a quick survey of the office. For now, planning to position the base stations at the centre of almost all tables - or whatever seems fit. There is surely a free power plug on the workstations so will work out minor details as I get the ball rolling. 

ARUP could possibly use a different approach, may need to ask arup if they have any specific ideas of the direction of deployment. But for now, will also do the same appraoch as BVN - positioning the base stations at the centre of the workstations. 

2. So experiment 8 still needs to be graphed up. I attempted to try this out last week for a few hours with rolling windows to limit the time frame of which the data needs to be graphed - whether it may be 5 seconds, 10 seconds etc. May need some help on that. Will try again tonight. 

3. No. 3 I'm not so sure of. Reason being is I get nervous with ranges. Whilst it may seem like a good idea, I'm not totally convinced its the way to go coming from the previous experiments we've done.

4. Side stuff - so planning to do the closest beacon visualisation as said from this post. The results from experiment 8 can also feed into the visualisation as it give me an idea of where the benchmark should be when averaging the data. If you have no idea what I'm referring to - look [here](http://where-in.space/2016/closest-beacon-visualisation)
