Another short and sweet one from me.

Made a start on the technology architecture flow graph/diagram. It can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B57wYK0849PWSlFWYlVjR1ZSWGs). Made it in draw.io. The amount of information is still on draft. Tell me what you think. 

Starts with a beacon > Access Point > Database

![Beacon]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/beacon_arch.png)

![Access Point]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/ap_arch.png)

![database]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/db_arch_1.png)

Although, been told db shouldn't be separated into two db's at all. Therefore, I took the 'people' out. To maximise the ethics of the project, any information that can reidentify the person being tracked should not be available to others. Can be treated on a different server for another time. It exists but not for the public/wider audience.

The endgame isn't a webserver, so there's still some adding to do. 

Don't worry yesterday's post will come soon!
