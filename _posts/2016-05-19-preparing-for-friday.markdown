Another short and sweet one from me.

Made a start on the technology architecture flow graph/diagram. It can be seen [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B57wYK0849PWSlFWYlVjR1ZSWGs). Made it in draw.io. I think it's a good start. Tell me what you think. Although, I can say that its a little all over the place, however, the information is getting there?

Don't worry yesterday's post will come soon!
