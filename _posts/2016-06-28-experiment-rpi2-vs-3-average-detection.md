Because we no longer have class on tuesdays, we are at arup conducting experiments. Two things we need to find out: which RPi is better at recieveing information(Rpi 2 or 3) and what is the average detection of RSSi over Time. 

# Experiment: Average detection and comparison of Rpi 2 vs 3 

### Stationary and moving with Rpi 2 vs Rpi 3 

Testing for: which one is more accurate. 
How: Which one picks up the strongest rpi(more fluxuation or less, more frequent recieved RSSi or not)

### Method: 

Time: we experiment 1, min 2 minute 10 minutes and found it wasn't a long enough time period to determine the average number of detections over time. Therfore we will try it for 1 hr this time. That is a long time for someone to be standing in one position so we will hang the beacon from the ceiling on a string instead.

### Analysis 

> TD/TT = A
>
> TD = Total detection over a period of time. 
> TT = Ttotal time 
> A  = Average detection of RSSi for a distance,
