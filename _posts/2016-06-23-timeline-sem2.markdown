So its coming to the second half of the year where we need to implement and analyse through our own angles of this project - whether its space utilisation, movement or face-to-face interaction.

Put together a draft timeline, and according to this, we're looking pretty tight on time if we want to give 6 weeks of data collection and 6 weeks of thesis writing. 

This can be seen [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wBEEeC5mE_rTeX7uv4tp1UxmF9mR-jGLnOtPqcW6ruU/edit?usp=drive_web).

So towards the end of the timeline is where we can have the option to split off and have different time - different data analysis times, different thesis writing plans etc. So this is able to be changed at any stage.

Still need to write what each topic means for clarification, e.g. implementation means electrician coming in, setting up the RPI, make sure its all up and running etc.
