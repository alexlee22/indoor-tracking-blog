### Topology 

According to wikipedia, Topology is concerned with the properties of space that are preserved under continuous deformations, such as stretching and bending, but not tearing or gluing. 

It means the cup...is topologically the same as the doughnut... Because we could(hyperthetcially morph, bend and pull either objects) and make the other.

A set, however, can be put, lay, or stand (something) in a specified place or position. Informally, a topology tells how elements of a set relate spatially to each other. The same set can have different topologies. For instance, the real line, the complex plane, and the Cantor set can be thought of as the same set with different topologies. 

These people are in the same set, and are topologically the same.

How this relates to the project is through comparison. If you can map the comparison topology, which means you have certain rules and parameters that guide a machine to look for specific characterticis(like a human interaction: closeness, timing, body position(facing forward)), then it makes it possible to use relatively simple data to deduce a human interaction...
