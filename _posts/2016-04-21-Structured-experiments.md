Some experts say we should do structured experiments in a certain way. Here is a summary I did of what I thought they said. 

# Conducting a Structured Experiment

Further structured experimentation to achieve objective 5) will focus around findings and literatures gathered during the literature review and semi-structured interviews completed during the research project. These structured experiments will follow observations and monetarization of participants within an indoor space that maps face-to-face interactions during a workday (as outlined in the research brief). 
According to Martyne Shuttleworth (2016) “Science revolves around experiments, and learning the best way of conducting an experiment is crucial to obtaining useful and valid results.” He also goes onto describe specific processes. Stage one is “hypothesis” developing. This includes project brief, significance, introduction, background and the formation of a strong research question. The second is sample groups should be divided, into a control group and a test group, to reduce the possibility of confounding. This should be random, and the assigning of subjects to groups should be blind or double blind. This will reduce the chances of experimental error, or bias, when conducting an experiment.
Small mention to ethics: Particularly at this stage ethical processes may become problematic, especially with the nature of the research project centering around Human Positioning. As initial responses these issues, the choice for participants to Opt-in or Opt-out at any point within the experiment will be available. The monetarization of participants will also only be conducted within designated experimental spaces, and will not continue beyond the boundaries of the experimental environment. This will aim to navigate unwanted intrusion into personal lives of the participants. This may prove in helpful in gathering valid results, however is the most appropriate when dealing with human subjects. 
Further mention to time-framing (between 5-8 Months of experimentation) and frequency of sampling (every week for 12 weeks approximately), depending on the level of theoretical saturation. Once experimentations have been conducted, the raw data from the results will be gathered, and analyzed, by (quantitative) statistical means, however, other forms of qualitative data such as surveys will also be recorded. Having a variety of data collection modes helps the researcher to establish if there is any relationship between the variables and accept, or reject, the null hypothesis (see Research Ethics for further detailing).
