Cutting straight to the chase.

To understand spatial movement paths of people in space, have to work out how to visualise it, well in our case it does. Mullaw (2008) has said there are two categories of showing moving objects - individual moving objects and group moving objects. The main goal of his research was to find the optimal representation for visualising walking people. This research is based on cartographic knowledge. 

1. Single static map
2. Multiple static maps
3. Animation
4. Position
5. Form
6. Orientation
7. Size
