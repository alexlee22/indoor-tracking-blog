description: Making life less hard for your readers

author: tiara
---
This post is basically a summary of how I plan to arrange my thesis as advised by Catherine Bridges today in class. She is pretty smart and gave quite a lot of good advice as to structuring and making life easy for your reader. 
There is quite a lot to get through so bear with me and try and read the whole post. Drop your comments/ concerns and or thoughts below, weither you agree/disagree or think I missed something and I'll add to it. 

# Quality not quantity
It is sometimes to out detriment that we 'designers' spend too much time making things look nice because, well, the types of people that are going to be markering our work are 'designers' who care about how nice things look. So how do we overcome these issues? we need to think carefully about what is the message we are trying to convey, and how is the best way of conveying it. 

### Conveying the message

1. It is the message that is important. (not the cover, but if making a nice cover help you convey the message, make that cover look nice). eg: a thesis on designing nice looking cover's, will definetly need a nice looking cover.(You Know What Im saying)
•	The story is the most important. Put effort into arranging the different elements into a flow that leads the reader through your process.  
•	general rule: Get content right, edit your content, then play with how it looks. 

In the long run, you need to think about who is marking your work, what are their values and can they appreciate your work? 
Thinking in this kind of way makes it easier to prioritize information. You can include information that is necessary to know, or nice to know. A general rule would keep you well away from the latter, however you need to think about the context that the reader is coming from, weither they might have a glass or two before reading your work, how familiar they are with your study area and what can you do to make things easier for them to understand/read. Sometimes making things look nice and adding diagrams (even though the text works by itself) makes the whole endeavor more pleasant for the reader/marker. And if your marker enjoys reading your paper, then well, you might get rewarded with a good mark. And who doesn't want a good mark? 
In a general sense, try and make your writing and use of images as if you were explaining to a friend in simple terms, however avoiding informal language. This is a normal style of thesis writing and overall gets good results as a style guide. 
(I get away with it in this blog post because its a blogpost, not a thesis essay!). 

### PLAN THE ESSAY AND ORGANISE IDEAS
•	There should be a central question that the essay is trying to answer 
•	Images help you explain things, even though you might not need it.

This image, references to later when I talk about introuction, main body and conclusion writing, but I thought it applies directly to what I talked about above. (so be nice to me!). 

### What does normal writing look like?

This leads us onto the second point for introducing your topics/theories/points within your thesis. 
•	Focus on the issue, not the writer, keeping your writing objective and impersonal can make it more convincing. 

1. "It will be argued that the benefit of sales promotion outweighs the disadvantage" 
2. "I will argue in this essay that (problem in using this, the responsibility falls directly on you, your credibility etc..)

There is no clear cut way of introducing these things, but you need to think through what the writing suggests about you. If you sound too arrogant/too overstating in your thesis, the marker might not like that and you might get a bad mark. (it’s all a power play, safe to stay objective and let the references do the talking, not you).

This is not to say you can't use 'I', but you enter into unfamiliar territory when you do so you better have some good explanation to back you up on everything you state/claim. 

### integrating Citations into your writing

This is good to keep in mind for when you are writing your literature review. There are two major ways of citing something:
General rule: No hard and fast way of doing things. 
(1)	Bridges (1987) says “We are awesome". 30% of the time.
(2)	We are awesome (bridges 1987) 70% of the time. 
You shouldn't have none of the first, but it’s generally good to stick with the second. If you’re making a statement, about your own point, and it is backed by a reference, use the second. If you are using a direct quote or piece of writing, use the first. (generally). 
### Writing your introduction 
Now every chapter has an introduction, and then you have your introduction Chapter (know the difference!!!!). 
The introduction is generally done last and introduces your core themes and ideas. It’s also a good way to let your reader to understand how you have organized your thesis (for way finding). 

Theme 1 = chapter 1
Theme 2 = chapter 2
etc...

### Avoid words with vague meanings

•	Compare
o	The writer looks to the issue
•	With
o	The writer examines the issues


The second option is more formal
•	Formal choices
o	He states…maintaining…argues
•	Informal choices:
o	He says…talks about…

### Cut the crap

If you’re in the editing stage, think carefully about the relevance of the writing. Is this a need to know, or is this a nice to know?

### Making claims

Make your claims tentative rather than definite
•	This leaves the door open for further discussion and/or research. After all, it’s unlikely that you’re reached the only possible conclusions!
•	Television viewing causes reading problems in childhood.
•	Excessive television viewing may be a contributing cause of some cases of reading problems in childhood. 

# ESSAY format/structure

1.	Preliminaries: Title page
2.	Main text: introduction, main body, conclusion
3.	End Matter: references 

### Preliminary 
•	The title page should contain information to enable your lecturer to identify exactly what the pieces of work is. It should include: 
o	Your group names and 
o	Course;
o	The title of the assignment
•	An editor is ok to have. 
You’re must acknowledge them all. 

### The introduction
•	The introduction consists of two parts:
o	It should include a few general statements about the subject to provide a background to your essay and to attract the reader’s attention. Your writing should try to explain why you are writing the essay. It may include a definition of terms in the content of the essay. Etc.
o	It should also include an indicative of how the topic is going to be tackled in order to specifically address the questions
•	It should introduce the central idea of the main purpose of the writing. 
•	Way finding in text: This chapter…1 goes into this 
•	Way finding goes into this. 
•	Naming the heading as a question may help you answer it. 

### The Main body

•	The main body of one or more paragraphs of ideas and arguments, together with illustrated or examples
•	The paragraphs are linked in order to connect the ideas
•	The purpose of the essay, used be made clear and reader must be able to follow its developments.
Flow of information in paragraphs
•	Paragraphs are usually structured as
o	Topic Sentence
	This is the first sentence and it expresses the main idea
o	Supporting sentences
	Details that expand your main idea
o	Concluding sentences 
	A rounding off, possible by summarizing what has been said or drawing a logical conclusion from it. The Thesis whisperer https://thesiswhisperer.com/

### The conclusion
•	The conclusion includes the writer’s final points
o	It should recall the issues raised in the introduction and draw together the points made in the main body 
•	And explain the overall significance of the conclusion. (what general points etc)
•	Recalling the main points you went over

# ADD SOME STYLE 

•	Writing is a very logical exercise, adding style to it will enhance clearness and power of convincing.
•	Phrases for the transition
•	Phrases for emphasis
•	Phrases for counterpoints


### PHRASES FOR EMPHASIS

•	Moreover(old English mate!)
•	In fact
•	Additionally 
•	For example
•	In point of fact 
•	As a matter of fact
•	Indeed
•	extrapolated(this sounds cool, but use it carefully)
Simple, and direct. 


### PHRASES FOR COUNTERPOINT

•	Conversely
•	On the other hand
•	However
•	Nevertheless
•	Notwithstanding
•	Nonetheless 
•	Yet
•	Despite
•	Although
•	Instead
It shows your argument

### Conclude writing

•	Writing = logic + style 
•	You should always concentrate on the objectives 
•	Good writing skills needs a lot of READING and exercise 
•	Writing is important for, university assignments, exams
Don’t forget about future work!
