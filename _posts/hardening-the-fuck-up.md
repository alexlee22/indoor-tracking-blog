description: Getting over my hate for stupid things

The time has come ...to learn... MongoDB (gasp!). To do this I have to think very carefully about how to implement some of the 
querie questions for the data base as mine may not be exactly the same as my partners Alex and Annisa. To do this I will need to explore my thesis question and aim very carefully.

# Project summary

I think it's important to state this now as the querie questions I will be asking from the database, will relate directly to what I want to achieve from the whole project. 

### The aim

To make observations about how a workplace is used by its employees. These observations will help to inform designers and enable them to design better workplaces. 

### Focusing the study

'To Make observations about how a workplace is used by its employees' can mean a wide variety of things. Specifically within my thesis I am more interested in  looking directly at the physical world in which the user enhabits(the workplace itself) and the social/phycological implications of that physical world (partciularly face to face interactions). 

### The motivation

By understanding how a workplace is used by its employees, it may help designers design better workplaces in the future which responde to the contemporary needs of the users. 

Right.. now that I have that out of the way, lets look at exploding the aim and identifying the 





Querie Questions
1. Find triangulation location of beaconID ("Bod jerry"), now inform "bob Jerry" that "dylan hanson" is looking for him. 

~~~ bash
distinct~~~ find the unique IDs within the value
find({}) find whatever is within the criteria of the curvy brackets
sort arranges by ascending or descending based on +/-
limit only shows x number of results


Duck debugging

![alt text]({{ site.baseurl}}/assets/duck_debugging.jpg)

Rubber duck debugging is an informal term used in software engineering for a method of debugging code. 
The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck 
and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line-by-line, to the duck. Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different inanimate objects.

Many programmers have had the experience of explaining a programming problem to someone else, possibly even to someone who knows nothing about programming, and then hitting upon the solution in the process of explaining the problem. In describing what the code is supposed to do and observing what it actually does, any incongruity between these two becomes apparent.[2] More generally, teaching a subject forces its evaluation from different perspectives and can provide a deeper understanding.[3] By using an inanimate object, 
the programmer can try to accomplish this without having to involve another person.
