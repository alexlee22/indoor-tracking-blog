Ben is in australia! so this smorning Annisa, Ben and I all sat down on the BVN verandah and went through where we at with the Indoor positioning project. After exploring a few concepts we made a todo list for our next steps in the project. 

# Blog Posts

The following titles outline a series of blogpost plans that I hope to finish by the end of the day9fingers crossed). The hope from doing this is that it will give a clear indication as to firstly: the issues, what is needed to address the issues, and methods for achieving solutions to the problems. 

### (1) WHY TIME BASED PATHS ARE NECESSARY	

1. what is time 

2. what are the various dimensions we are dealing with in this project: Speed, time, space etc. 

3. How can we explain that a differenctiating between moments in 'time' is necessary to determine when an interaction(or potential for interactions occured over the course of the day) and what that looks like in a visual sense. 

### (2) PARAMETER SPACE --> DISPLAYING GEOMETRY

1. concepts of segments

2. definitives and infinitive space 

3. How this leads to determining topology, 

### (3) CONCEPTS OF TOPOLOGY 

1. what is topology: how is it define, 

2. how does it relate to this project and what are the various layers within this project.

### (4) POTENTIAL LAYERS FOR DESCERNING INTERACTIONS 

1. Outline any literature for identifying an interaction 

2. Potential interaction scenarios and what are the assumptions I will be making within my angle of the project

3. what are the the 1dimensional, 2 dimensional and 3rd dimensional layers within the project. 

### (5) WORKING FROM PERFECT --> SHITTY : CONCEPTS OF TELIOGOLOGY

1. Define teliology 

2. How it relates to this project 

3. what are my movements from here and until the end of the project(plan/sequencee of events, outcomes and methods)

4. potential to outsource unessessary problem solving to other more qualified people and leaving the real jucy bits to me. 

### (6) CREATING PERSONAL BASED INTERACTIONS: ETHICS 

1. Ethics for capturing the demographics of people

2. How that can be done

3. should that be done? 

### (7) AUTOMATED VS VISUAL ANALYTICS 

1. Automatting = (hyperthetcially) There were 5 potential interactions over course of day

2. Visualising the interaction and how you can draw attention to the event(analysing the process and effectiveness in communication)
