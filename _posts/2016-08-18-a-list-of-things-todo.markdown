Ben is in australia! So this morning Annisa, Ben and I all sat down on the BVN veranda and went through where we at with the Indoor positioning project. After exploring a few concepts we made a to do list for our next steps in the project. 

# Blog Posts

The following titles outline a series of blog post plans that I hope to finish by the end of the day (fingers crossed). The hope from doing this is that it will give a clear indication as to firstly: the issues, what is needed to address the issues, and methods for achieving solutions to the problems. 

### (1) WHY TIME BASED PATHS ARE NECESSARY	

So for interaction, time is important because it may be very well to compare peoples paths during a day but you wont be able to determine an interaction if their paths don't come within close proximity with one another at the same point in time. Without time movement doesn't exist.

1. what is time - animations vs. static images

2. what are the various dimensions we are dealing with in this project: Speed, time, space etc. 

3. How can we explain that differentiating between moments in 'time' is necessary to determine when an interaction (or potential for interactions occurred over the course of the day) and what that looks like in a visual sense. 

4. Possible problems

### (2.1) PARAMETER SPACE --> DISPLAYING GEOMETRY

explain difference between metric vs parameter space, co-write this post, explaining the difference.

1. concepts of segments

2. definitives and infinitive space 

3. How this leads to determining topology

### (2.2) CONCEPTS OF TOPOLOGY 

1. what is topology: simple define - use mug/donut example

2. how does it relate to this project and what are the various layers within this project.

### (3) POTENTIAL SCENARIOS THAT MAY OR MAY NOT INDICATE AN INTERACTION  

1. Outline any literature for identifying an interaction 

2. Potential interaction scenarios and what are the assumptions I will be making within my angle of the project

3. what are the the 1 dimensional and 2 dimensional layers - what is the difference between the two, why is 3 dimensional not as important

4. Draw and animate potential scenarios

### (4) WORKING BACKWARDS FROM PERFECT

Instead of working forwards from the data, have the idea of your final outcome and work backwards as a way of getting to your perfect scenario.

1. Define teliology 

2. How it relates to this project 

3. what are my movements from here and until the end of the project(plan/sequence of events, outcomes and methods)

4. Focusing on an outcome in the end, and the parts that we can solve and leave the parts that we can't solve to others.

### (5) CREATING PERSONA BASED DATA

1. Ethics for capturing the demographics of people

2. How that can be done

3. should that be done? 

4. Demonstrate the capability of the system, ethics will only be an issue if using real data

### (7) AUTOMATED VS VISUAL ANALYTICS 

Gradient idea between presenting someone with raw, dirty data to visualization and result at the end. 

1. Automating = (hypothetically) There were 5 potential interactions over course of day

2. Visualizing the interaction and how you can draw attention to the event(analyzing the process and effectiveness in communication)

### (8) NAVGRAPHS

Going through the process and limitations of the navgraph in the GH/Rhino script.

1. Creating

2. Maximising points on floor plan

3. Inclusion and Exc.

4. Manual edits

5. Progress/Update

6. Using Offsets around Boundaries to determine a more natural path

7. Read Sq&at, talk to Dan.

### (9) Slicing Data and representing them in a visualisation

1. Using dimensions of time

2. Dimensions of people - individual and group 

3. Talk about how others have represented this in different ways - colour, opacity, vectors, lines etc.
