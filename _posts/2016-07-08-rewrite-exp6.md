So as requested by Ben I have included an experimental write up/diagram of what we did for the experiment 6 yesterday.

# Fixed diagrams -kinda 

These are fixed, kinda. I'm not really sure. I still think this is wrong, but anyways, here is what I came up with when I moved the values of the RSSi to their corresponding angle. That means when i was at 90 degrees, I worked out what was the RSSI value for that specific meter 

### Estimote

###  iPKS105

# Also! 

So apparently Annisa has already done the last json file for the ARUP floor plan which is a good thing. Ill continue working through my to do list from my last post over the weekend. Also I might end up combining these two posts later when I get bothered so read while you can suckers!!
