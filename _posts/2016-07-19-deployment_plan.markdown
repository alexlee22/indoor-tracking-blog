# Where in space: Deployment Plan

### Introduction

Where in space is a collective research endeavour aimed at collecting the patterns and movements of individuals within a workplace. Issues of office utilisation, circulation and interaction will be analysed and used as a pilot study to inform future workplace designs. The data is collected with Bluetooth Low Energy tracking tags as part of an indoor positioning system which are worn by a large sample of participants within a workplace. This document is to describe the deployment plan for the indoor positioning system research project within offices ARUP and BVN. 

### Phase 0

1.	Data Base completed: capable of hosting 8000+ detections a day. 

2.	Plan of  Base Station locations be finalised

3.	A simulation/ visualisation demonstration of dummy data ready for presentation. 

4.	Conduct presentation outlining what it will mean to implement an indoor positioning system within the office, the benefits and the costs. 

### Phase 1

1.	Ordering of Hockey Pucks x 100

2.	Ordering of raspberry piâ€™s x 50

3.	Placing Hockey pucks into cases with personalised item numbers

4.	Placing raspberry pis into cases 

5.	Getting card readers ready

6.	Initial test to make sure broadcasts are being received. 

### Phase 2

1.	Cabling and necessary wiring around workplaces

2.	Issuing out hockey pucks to people, taking their details and assigning a uuid number to each individuals to approximately 30 people

3.	Run a work shop or morning tea with a presentation about what we will be doing and why to get people on board. If people have questions answer all of them. 

### Phase 3: 

1.	Trialling the system for one day. 

2.	Make any changes and check approximate veracity by random video review and comparison with detections. 

3.	Write a report outlining the initial test what issues were uncovered and how we fixed the problem. 

### Phase 4: 

1.	Full office deployment

2.	1 Month of data collection. 

### Phase 5:

1.	Data analysis and conclusions 

2.	Project
