To keeeeep Ben happy, I made his little base station/ creepy light detection thingy he designed. Take a look.

The lighting sensing thingy works by grabbing the total 365 area of the sphere and reflecting that back to the camera. Instead of a 180 or even 250 degree vision, we can have up to 360 degree vision(cool!)
