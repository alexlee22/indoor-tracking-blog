# Analysis of experiments 1-8

### Introduction

As we are going to be writting up the experiments within our thesis, it is extremly important our experiments are not only valid, reliable, and have a control, but are also are properly reflected apon(what ever that means). Its starting to get to that time where we can finally start to do major steps in our research progress, therefore we can start writing about it. I for one think we need a clearer reflection process of everything we have done which will make our lives easier when doing the write up. I am following this: <b> teachertech.rice.edu/Participants/louviere/lessons/les1.html </b> as prescribed by our good old friend Bendo. This is a good chnace for us all to reflect on our process as we have moved through the project, what we have learnt and how our methods have chnaged based on our findings. This blog post is a document in progress, and all mssing information will eventually be added. 

# Experiment 1

### Purpose

To identify the appropriate location of the Base Station in the z axis for future positioning. 

### Hypothesis

Base Stations positioned up high which are clear from material obstruction(and maintain a clear line of sight will reciever higher numbers of detection and higher rssi value then those that do not). 

### Materials

1. Base Station(Raspberry pi), 
2. Beacon (estimote sticker), 
3. various miscellanious wiring and laptops for recording data(see procedure)

### Procedure

Three Base stations were positioned at different heights, one at ceiling height(2.5m from the floor plate), one at mid height(1m from the floor plate) and one positioned on the ground(0m from the floor plate). 

![experiment 1 set up diagram]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/exp1/exp1_setup.jpg) 

We recorded at 2 minute intervals for both a moving person and a stationary person for three consecutive tests. We tested with a moving beacon because that effected the broadcast density of the beacon(see http://where-in.space/2016/estimote-sticker-advertising-interval and http://where-in.space/2016/Understanding-RSSI-101).

### Control

Because the IPS is going to be placed within an activity based work environment(ABW) it was descided that the majority of the experiments would be conducted within that same environment to ensure the behaviour of the beacon and the basestations remains constant. 

### Results

### Observations

In general, experiment 1 gave us a very good indication that placing the Raspberry pi on the ground was the leaste effective in collecting signals. We know this as the amount of detections was nearly half that of the mid height and ceiling height recordings. We found that the stationary beacon was detected more by the ceiling height base station when the beacon was moving, then when it was stationary. The oposite is true if the beacon is stationary, the base station recieved more detections when the beacon was lower on the z axis at mid height.  

### Conclusion

The findings gave an indication(key word here) that if you are moving, your more likely to be picked up by a low flying or 'mid height' base station. On the other hand, if your stationary, then its better to put the base station up high. Therefore when we go to place Rpi's around the office, we might want to think carefully about the type of activity a person might be doing irespective of the xy coordinant position within floor plan. 

# Experiment 2

### Purpose

### Hypothesis

### Materials

### Procedure

### Observations

### Conclusion 

experiment 2 seems to be missing? (eek!)

### Experiment 3

In a controlled environment, is it possible to record and measure the rssi values when influenced by height, distance, speed recorded magnitude intervals. 

In overall, this is an ok experiment but what it does give us is some indication as to the behaviour of the rssi and the shape of signals. The estimote was our experimentation beacon and we have since moved onto using another type of beacon(the hockey pucks). so in essents, its ok to refer to but not in great detail. we might need to think more carefully about writing this bad boy up again or even repeating the experiment with new technology.

### Experiment 5

Measuring the rssi detected as the beacon moves between four Raspberry pi's. Two at midheight and two at ceiling height. group 1 consisted of one of the Rpi at mid height and ceiling height at one end of 8 metres and group 2 also consisting of 

Om this is when we started to get better at our experimentation process but unfortunately one of the Rpi's died therefore we might need to repeat this experiment, however I think if we do a good job at recording experiment 1 we might not have too(mess is more). 
Also the graphing still needs alot of work and could be done very quickly through protly or jupyter. 
This experiment could also have some more diagrams and image sof the set up(common people!)
