#S×3 Final Touches
The S×3 is very close to being ready to plug in to the Raspberry Pis and collecting data!

##Current state
- All have been bootloaded and are programmable via USB on my windows 10 machine.
- A python script has been written to accept data over USB and print to file via stdout.
- Alex has assisted in setting up python scripts and my own AWS server to colelct the sensor data from the RPis

##What's left?
-
