### What is it?

Estimote beacons are small wireless radio sensors which assist in identifying the location of an object in which a tag is attached. The SDK allows developed to make applications and programs to suit their necessary requirements. The beacons are certified Apple iBeacons and Google Eddystone, two developing Bluetooth Low Energy protocols that will become popular in 2016.

### How does it work?

- Estimote beacons and beacon stickers broadcast radio signals,
- Smart devices (phones and other BLE) within ranges interact with these beacons,
- SDK, Estimotes cloud or BLE devices use collected data to find the location of each beacon.

### Whats their products

Estimote Stickers: Small BLE beacons for taging objects
Estimote Proximity Beacons: Powerful BLE beacons
Estimote Distance Beacons: Proximinity beacons with GPIO

### Estimote development

Estimote is still in development with productions. Their SDK is freely available for developers to use. The beacons can be connected to other Bluetooth Low Energy devices. We further plan to use the beacons and SDK with the Raspberry Pi devices to track the movement of volunteers in an indoor environment.
