The estimote location beacons arrived at alex's door! So we set them up and tested to see how well they work in terms of accuracy, speed, whether it picks up the exact location of yourself with a smartphone. We also tested these in conjunction with the estimote stickers.

There was a total of 6 estimote beacons. In order to place the beacons at the right locations, needed to calibrate the room. The room we used was BVN's Project North room - a small meeting room. 

We used the estimote app to find the dimensions of the room. You start from one corner and walk around the perimeter until you get the shape of the room. As you can see from the image below, it is not so accurate unless you take your sweet time. This room was quite small so i can imagine what it will be like for the whole office.

Then it will prompt you to place the beacons at the locations they tell you to. So there was 2 beacons on the longer side of the room and 1 beacon on the shorter side of the rooms.

Then you had to calibrate which takes a while.

then we tested its accuracy! So where i was in the room was almost where it said i was on the estimote app. The stickers however, went a little crazy on the app and said it was on me when it was about 1m away on the table.

My thoughts:
 - With more care and time taken when doing the initial set up - you can get more of an accurate location on where you in space from the app. 
 - However, to get to that stage - it does take a long time and it questions how many beacons we would need for such a large open space like bvn and arup. Obviously the more beacons there are, the more accurate the results would be. We used 6 for small room - which personally I think is a lot considering its about $99 for 3. 
 - The stickers, however, i'm not too sure what happened there. It was bugging out.
