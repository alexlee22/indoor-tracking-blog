Over the weekend, just been preparing and finishing off an assignment due Monday. The assignment required to provide a review of selected research methods. It required to analyse research to demonstrate the knowledge you have of the field and argue why this information is important is relevant to my methodology.
I did a systematic review of the previous experiments done with different technologies - GPS, camera, WiFi, BlE

Can be seen here > https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Jt5QnY6SenE_8yRhaHRrsmCr2o3CN6Ud-bPNyWoJAyE/edit

I got good feedback but being critical on myself, it needs to be further further further refined and have a better structure - better flow, better information. 
Something i should think about: 

- Should I only focus on those technologies listed in that assignment? Why?

- Being more technical with information < the assignment was a lot of overviews and basic information as there was a word limit

- What other parameters are needed to understand face-to-face patterns?

- What type of information is needed for architects to help design better workplaces?

Monday:

- Caught up with Tiara over the phone.

- As she is not able to perform any experiments whilst she is away, I drilled her about other things she can work on in the meantime - the beacon deck, reading more/adding to the annotated doc and any contribution to the acadia paper. 

- This post is published now so no hiding T ;)

Today:

- Plan to try out of the courier experiment.
