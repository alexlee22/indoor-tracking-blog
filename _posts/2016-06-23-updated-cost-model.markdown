So, updated the cost model on [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1M43rWYlgAy95g27Mp202UL6_K9fjLoq766Cmmh3SibE/edit?usp=drive_web).

One thing both organisations have mentioned that cost isn't an issue, but nonetheless, this cost model helps to understand cost comparisons anyway. 

Based on a RPI comparison chart found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BynqiTdA7wKZczQ5dGhpU0ZjVGc), we found that that RPI 2: B+ and RPI 3 is the most appropriate for this indoor tracking project. However, given that RPI2 needs additional hardware such as the WiFi and BLE dongles, thought that it might be worth checking and testing out the RPI 3 as it already has WiFi and BLE integrated into the technology. Its also cheaper the RPI 3 alone than buying RPI 2 with additional hardware by minimum $500. 

Testing the technology means:
- Testing the RSSI 'accuracy' of RPI 2 vs RSSI of RPI 3
- Accuracy meaning whether the RSSI fluctuates less, the RSSI when converting to distance.

Also found that the RPI2's are frequently stocked out or will take a while to stock back in as the resellers get the RPI's from other suppliers. 

Also, still need to put in prices for SD cards, so will do that straight after this.
