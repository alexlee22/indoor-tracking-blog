As per the deployment plan, we are to give an information session(kinda like the TAD talk format they have at BVN on thrsdays) so today I worked on the information session presentation slides.

still on its way but I wanted to draw close attention to the following things:

1. what the project is about

2. what that means for the practise and those that choose to get involves

3. what we intend to do with the data (circulation, space utilisation and face-to-face interaction analysis)

other areas include: Privacy, a summary of the project, a brief intro into beacons and base stations(how they work).
