Oh boy. Ethics at last. This day was inevitable but I always thought it would been a little easier, but in truth our experimentation and even our whole honors project has got some pretty narly ethics issues. 


### People's locations 

OK this is a no brainer. No matter what ethics application i hand in, and no matter how well versed the research is, I am still fundamentally tracking people. And people might not like that. 
but..... I'm not going to be tracking those people. I'm going to be tracking people that are OK with being tracked, plus their identity is hidden, they are in a secure environment(not personal life) like a workplace(where their actions are open to be scrutinized by their superiors and fellow colleagues anyway). 

So who cares? its just your personal information right??? 

We'll if this technology is used for evil, then no more 40 minute lunch breaks for you my friend. say good bye to flirting with the cute guy at the office over the water cooler. Your time is being watched and how you use it defines you. This goes against our feeling of freedom and is pretty annoying to say the least. Its good for management teams, they can fire people now based on their time/work usage (it will! I betcha!). 

Human Research Ethics Committees (HRECs)gives a pretty good description of ethics:

### Storing the stuff

As part of the ethics application for experimentation, we need to tell how we are going to store the stuff. For research reasons, the University compels us to store the gathered data from 5-10 years depending. 
The people we are working with like Architectural firms(with the potential to give confidential/private information) don't like this idea very much. 

issues include: Employees information via a server(these things could get hacked!) This make sit harder for us as we need reliable/valid experimental results and we can't get that unless we use names stored within a database. 


### Solution 
 
We can't not store the data, and we can't just have the data out the plain sight: Therefore our solution is to separate the information into separate(secure) data bases. One is for research reasons, and the other is for the office authority manager to keep under lock and key (HOORAY everyone wins!)

This is kinda how it would work

This is as far as I got with these issues. Ill go through the others in the coming week. 

### Honors work progress

Today I worked.. err. So tonight I'm just compiling all my past assignments together and making sure they make sense. Ethics was due today, but I asked for an extension to the end of the week. Writing it now (eeeek!).
