Forming a well structured methodology is extrememly important for any research project. Good methodology building helps to
give direction to the researcher as well as inform the reader of steps that were taken during your experimentation. This helps for 
validity/quality of results checking and future improvements.

# Outlining structure for methodology creating 

•	Intro the methods chapter: Integrate some way finding  eg "(1) etc. structure 2) this will say this, 3) thirdly this will say this."
•	This is what we are going to do 
•	This is what we are going to use
•	These are some of the issues we might come across, this is what we are going to do to overcome these issues. 
Tip: pull some prewritten method and then pull the parts that are associated to your experiment/change data to, and keep the language as simple as possible. 

### Definitions

Some definitions I learnt today

Taxonomy: organizing classification of knowledge 
Anomy: knowledge 
Ontology: the branch of metaphysics dealing with the nature of being

## Strength of Qualitative research 

•	High levels of flexibility in the research process
•	Research done in natural settings
•	Emphasis on informant interpretation and meanings
•	Seek deep understanding of informants 

### Weaknesses of Qualitative research 

•	Problems of reliability
•	“subjectivity”
•	Circulation
•	Observations maybe selectively reporting
•	Over representation 
•	Politics/ ongoing social etc. 
•	Risk of collecting meaningless and useless information from participants
•	Problems of ethics 
•	Very time consuming 
•	Interviews: edit conversation before they tell you 
•	Conveying agenda/panning for gold/sieve or way of doing that
•	Issues of objectivity.
