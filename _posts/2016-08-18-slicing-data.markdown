So slicing data is something we'll all have to deal with at some stage of the process in our own angles, but how much we need to slice the data will differ between each person. But some things that are very similar is looking at:

1. Dimensions of time

This deals with slicing the data in relation to time. As time is a big factor for each our angles, we need to understand how we represent and separate the times into a user-friendly visualisation. This means visualising it possibly for not only a whole day, but also portions of the day, peak (lunchtimes) and off-peak (late night deadlines). To understand how people behave in a workplace, you need to understand what they do on a day to day basis but also weekly etc as there can be significant human patterns that can arise between day to day, week to week. Wood and Keller (1996) identified 5 categories of temporal information represented through maps - moments, duration, structured time, Time as distance and space as clock. Mullaw (2008) took 3 of these parameters (moment, duration and order) and used it in the context of moving objects such as walking people and made some diagrams that could potentially help represent time with moving objects in static images.

2. Dimensions of people

This deals with slicing data in relation to individuals or groups of people that are being tracked. Understanding human behaviour in workplace environments can be really useful but it can also be more useful if we know the types of people using it as for example, hotdesking people may possibly move more flexibly around the office vs people with assigned seating but none of this information will be useful if we dont know who they are. 

Colour:
One way we can represent this information is if we separate individuals or groups of people with separate colours. Because we're dealing with somewhat indoor cartography, it is important to understand what colours are suitable. There is alot of research that deals with what is an acceptable colour spectrum as it is designed to help people understand maps. There are three main palettes: sequential, diverging and qualitative. This can either help to categorise people using good visual colours as backed up by cartographic research and/or help to determine paths of people in space.

Ethics:
So there was also a talk about categorising people. Theres two levels to this project - ethics and technological level. In order for my angle to be even more effective and analyse spatial movements,
