<b> Data Analysis

- Before experiments - determine inclusion and exclusion of data - argue why?

<b> Process
- Review other people's work - what they did, what worked, what did not

- Generate discussion - argue how their experiment will part to your own (learning from other people's notes, troubles and successes)

- Read and review all data recieved

- Begin detailed analysis

- Interpret and generate description

<b> Checking Credibility

- Member checking - 'In qualitative research, a member check, also known as informant feedback or respondent validation, is a technique used by researchers to help improve the accuracy, credibility, validity, and transferability (also known as applicability, or fittingness) of a study'.

- Whether there is a rich and thick description 

- Clarification of bias - e.g. tracking single person vs. multiple people to identify patterns

- Whether there is any negative, disrepant information

- Prolonged field data

- Peer debriefing

<b> Ethnography - Personal Observation

- A picture of the 'way of life' of some identifyable group of people

- Social and cultural considerations - similar to anthropology

- Outcome = ethnography narrative account

<b> Process

- Ethnographer is the primary instrument

- Requires to take data throughout a year or more - to see full life cycle

- Tension and balance between involvement and detachment
  
  - Observer vs. participant
  - Is emotion/culture involved?
