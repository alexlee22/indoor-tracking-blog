So basically I wrote a whole bunch of stuff over the weekend for the arcadia paper, thinking I had to have everything done on friday the 22. thank goodness for an extensions!

# what I wrote because its needed some TLC..

### Introduction

In recent years, a plethora of tracking technologies have flooded commercial market places. The Global Positioning System (GPS) is able to trace people or objects with a high degree of accuracy outdoors (REF), however is unable to do the same when walls, floors and other physical obstructions cause satellite attenuation (Mautz 2008). A different method for tracking people or objects is therefore needed for indoors. 
Although the GPS has become majorly standardised, there is yet to be a standardised Indoor Positioning System (IPS) used by the general public. This is problematic for many as there is also a lack of understanding of the effectiveness of the variety of IPS available. 
 Comprehensive reviews of available IPS and their suitability are hard to collect and often agenda driven, leading to inappropriate placement of IPS within unsuitable indoor environments. A comprehensive review of available IPS products should evaluate reliability of technology, accuracy, coverage, availability, cost, infrastructure as well as other parameters not mentioned. Suitability to specific Indoor environments (Office floor space, Suburban houses, Large shopping malls, Schools, etc.) should also be included when evaluating IPS products (REF). These reviews should be objective and provide clarity to readers about suitability of products and methods before introducing an IPS.
 
 ### Background
 
IPS have many potential applications which are being recognised to a variety of professionals of the Built Environment. Retailers are seeing the opportunity in IPS for close customer profiling, matching advertisement to the placement and movement of individuals within an indoor space. 
Work management teams are also looking to introduce the technology as means for tracking workers time use and observe how the space is occupied during the day or in real-time. 

Activity Based Working (ABW) Environments is a trend in interior design fitouts that companies like MIRVAC, Macquarie Bank, Microsoft, Commonwealth Bank are adopting in various forms. ABW are shifting dynamics in workplaces, however are creating problems as well. These shifting office space work environments are aided by the use of communication technologies such as instant messaging, Skype, IM, and Smart portable devices mean workers can communicate anywhere from their home, to a remote corner of an office desk or Café lounge. (Lee, Parker, xxxx). Office management are, however having to overcome new obstacles including: cultural adjustment, Legal issues for job delegation and accountability, and locating individuals at any given time to encourage face-to-face interactions amongst workers (Brown, 2008).

Given this context the objectives of this paper is to: (a) list and review a wide variety of IPS in an ABW indoor environments; (b) make critical analysis reliability of technology, accuracy, coverage, availability, cost, infrastructure as well as other parameters not mentioned, (c) establish a taxonomy of IPS to rule out IPS unable to operate in ABW’s; and (d) use these findings to outline next steps in the research towards testing the suitable IPS in ABW and e) outline next steps in widening indoor environment scope of product testing 

### Aim

The paper aims to provide a comprehensive technology review of a number of  IPS within an ABW environment.  
IPS products will be analysed against the following parameters. 
If the program successfully locates an object in real-time
The level of accuracy is in locating people or objects (in Meters)
The level of signal attenuation - from physical obstructions e.g. materials, surrounding technologies interception, human interruption. 
Can behavioural patterns be drawn from observing people or object position or movements through the product. 
Motivation
Having comprehensive reviews of the majority of IPS products gives a competitive advantage to retailers, office space management teams and other professionals within the Built environment.
