So Alex and I made some more progress on the ACADIA paper due next friday.
Can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TOP8hbP5tGvcG8SKAddURZvKOHg_yaM5LSJxACgmWaE/mobilebasic#
Old version here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1HpB89197DrZDj180aLALbHt-49Uh8ahRJVgnBkJAvHM
We added a little more structure, majority of the paper is filled out.
Theres still alot of culling that needs to happen - chopping and changing as the word count is over the maximum, as well as flushing out all the dirty, bad worded stuff.

The technologies we tried to focus on were the most commercially available, viable, accurate and most developed indoor positioning system. We used the listed IPS for our evaluation against our case study- Case study being the brief of the honours project.
Reason being is due to the fact that each indoor positioning system is tailored for each scenario. One indoor positioning solution may not be applicable for another. 

Over the weekend:

All three of us kids have an assignment due Monday. Assignment being a critical review of texts to support the reasoning of our methodology. 

Thoughts about the meeting today:

- Coming out of that meeting, personally (Annisa) felt a little more hopeful than I did coming in! Obviously there is a lot of work to do, which has been clouding my judgement.

Plans for next week:

Thursday: Alex and I are coming into ARUP's office to do some cat tracking/courier implementation. However, hope to carry out an experiment before then. 

Overall list of things to do throughout the week:

- ACADIA paper (aimed to do majority (if not all) to free time for our upcoming crit review assignment)

- Replicate tracking experiment

- Catherine's crit review
