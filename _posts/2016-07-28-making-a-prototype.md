Ben made us a nice design for the Base Stations which is what this post is about. I only made very small tweeks due to availability and sizes of materials. 

### Original Design: Where in space 1.01

Unfortunately, there wasn't any available plastic clear tubing in the diameter we needed. Also I thought to flip the camera around so it lies flat on the top of the surface of the white PVC piping. 

### Next level shit: Where in space 1.02

### Functions

1. House a Raspberry Pi in a secure and stable position

2. Allow cabling to flow through 

3. Cover any exposed cabling close the the raspberry pi

4. Hold a camera in the head of the pod in a secure and stable position 

5. Allow the camera full 360 view of its surrounding context

### Finished producT

TBC...  (awaiting 3D printing to finish and then assembly can commence!)
