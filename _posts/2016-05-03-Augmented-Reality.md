### Word Press: Error with Visual Composer

Today was more website stuff at work, mostly formatting and playing with numbers. I found out you shouldn't mess with the 'Classic editor' stuff where normal website people would place their own code into, if you want to make wordpress act like 'indesign' for example, you can't even chnage a number, otherwise wordpress will think you want to add information that way from now on. Its a glitch in the newest
update of Wordpress and will save you a world of hurt if you know before hand. 

### VIVID Augmented Reality for 2016 Plotemi project. 

By the way, I'm kinda doing a VIVID project, like I have a job in it. Its sorta cool the stuff I'm doing, except I haven't really done it before. 
Basically, I'm working with a bunch of UNSW students and creating an animation that can be viewed via Geo Location through a downloadable app. I have never done anything like this before so I have done some initial notes on my other blog: http://augmentedrealitywithgeolocation.blogspot.com.au/
eventually once the project is over I am going to write up the whole process into some sort of documentation. 

### Making an App
As part of the VIVID project, I'm also learning app development which is kinda awesome for future Tiara, however I am having some major **issues" with the project is the actual app launch and testing. My team haven't yet worked out some errors in the application and  we 
are also working towards a time push as VIVID launches at the end of May and app approval time is 1-2 weeks(Gaaa) that means, this weekend is going to be a FLURRY.

### Progress in Indoor Positioning System

Ethics is still in the works, got to get things rolling with this by Monday next week otherwise it might not come back in time for the comensment of experimentation.
The major priority is just Acadia right now. We are making good progress but still have a lot too go. I think the major things we need to do is focus on structure. 

### MongoDB and CodeSchool

Almost at the end of Javascripting tutorial 2 and about to start tutorial 3. The next on the priorities is the Mongo tutorial(obviously) but this needs to be done properly to set a good president for the data set up. Ben Doherty writes a good blog about setting up a MongoDB from beginning to end. 
Still need to have a real solid crack at working the estimote stickers with the Raspberry Pi. 

Ben Doherty writes a good description for setting up a Mongo DB for when I get too it. 

"I've never actually set up mu own mongo database before, I've always been the least useful person on the team. I thought I'd give it a go and document it.
https://github.com/notionparallax/SimpleMongNode Here's a repo with some working code.
and here's the working app: https://infinite-castle-45974.herokuapp.com/
It's on heroku because they seem to have the lowest friction to getting going. Once you've got your head around how mongo and node actually work then you can get your hear around how to configure an AWS thingo
the end points are `https://infinite-castle-45974.herokuapp.com/in-url-params?rssi=50&base=home` that puts data into mongo
visit the first one a few times so that there's a bit of data in there then:
`https://infinite-castle-45974.herokuapp.com/out-url-params-base?base=home` this gets it back out again. 
The routes are just hacked together, so if anyone has any comments then I'm all ears. Also I've tried to privilege readability over good software engineering.
I'm going to put in some examples where we post JSON too, but not today. I feel like I've got a bit of a buffer before you get to the point where you need this!"

Benny BOO! this is just so I can come back and have a look later instead of scrolling through yonks of slack commentary.
