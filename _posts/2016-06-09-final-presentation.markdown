So last week, we all had the chance to do a mock presentation before the final. 

Some notes I got after the presentation.

- More references and images at the end - citation, numbering
- SPEAK SLOWER
- Replace image of the database and put in a nicer one thats more clearer
- Show basic concepts of my visualisation
- Talk about pilot research - what did and what didn't work along the way - inclusion and exclusion

Mainly focused the presentation on the thesis side of the project, so my presentation focused on the visualisation of movement and how I would go about that based on the findings. Alex was before me, so I didn't want to repeat myself by repeating what was already said - about technology, the database, the ethics. Whilst it was mentioned, it wasn't the main show.

So the final presentation - I took those notes on board on cleaned it up just a little bit more. Can find it [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1RjLI0KlCy99NWqED6ou6aief7l5aHq1AGvqZj15unx0/edit?usp=drive_web).
