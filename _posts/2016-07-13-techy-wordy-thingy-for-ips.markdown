I kinda get stuff a bit muddled up or use the wrong words in the wrong context. However, knowing my weaknesses, I am more sensitive to being accommodating for other challenged people like me that might find things hard to grasp at the very beginning of a project. I know for one thing, I got confused between specific jargon that I wasn't familiar with and was too scared to ask in case of looking stupid. So to save others the head ache, I wanted to create a kind of 'Techy IPS wordy guide' for all dem (yes I am the O.G)readers that get confused with big words. 

For example, I have used the word 'Beacon' to mean the Raspberry Pi and sometimes the Blue tooth Low energy devices we are using within this project even though they are completely different. This gets confusing for any of those readers that don't mind read(we sorry). Therefore I decided to start a 'Matter of speaking' which can be a work in progress and we can always add to later. 

The aim of it is to act like a document we give to any newbies that have never worked with Indoor Positioning systems, Bluetooth Beacons, Raspberry Pi's etc so that can know exactly what we are talking about from the Get-Go. So here is my first stab at the document, outlining a few things I know and their definitions. 

### A Matter of Speaking: For IPS

rssi: received signal strength indicator

uuid: universally unique identifier

tx: measured power

IPS: Indoor Positioning system

ble: Bluetooth Low energy(not the same as Bluetooth)

Beacon: The signal broadcaster(The device we are tracking, might be BLE but not necessarily). 

Raspberry Pi(Rpi): A small computer like reciever that monitors the position of the beacon

Base Station: Just another word for the reciever

Participant: A volunteer that participates in the study or experiment

Agent: A simulation persona thingy(still not sure) that is deployed to check a hypothetical human behaviour within an environment. 


<b>... Ill add more to this later...</b>

### My loathing for the "just Google it" phrase

It is all very well to say to your college "ah just google it" but if the person doesn't know where to start, or do not know enough about the project, how are they going to be able to look for the right answers? Ben Doherty wrote a cool blog about this https://notionparallax.co.uk/2016/a-thinking-trick-for-beginner-programmers (you can thank me later Ben!).

I think when people work with people, they flurish and everyone enjoys themselves, I certainly enjoy annoying the heck out of my peers with questions!
