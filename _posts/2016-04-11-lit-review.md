On my flight to tahiti this smorning, I got the chance to read "through Undertaking a literature review:
a step-by-step approach" by Patricia Cronin, Frances Ryan, Michael Coughlan. I got alot out of this article 
and its worth a good read when you get a chance. 
As a general rule of thumb, when your conducting an annotated bibliograsking the following templates for Primary, secondary(reviews) and  
non-research literature for each article you read(related to your topic) is a ong process but is extrememly helpful in the end.

# Literature review

After you have finished your annotated bibliography for at leaste the majority of your articles(articles are better than books),
you can start working towards making/writting your literature review. 

### There are a number of over points you should keep in mind before you commense your lit-review. (I got this from the article,
Im not that original), anyway keep these in mind...

- Undertaking a literature review is a key feature in many courses of study,
an essential step in the research process, and is fundamental in the
development of clinical practice and policy.

-Types of literature reviews include narrative or traditional; systematic review;
meta-analysis and meta-synthesis.

- Undertaking a literature review includes identification of a topic of interest,
searching and retrieving the appropriate literature, analysing and synthesizing
the findings and writing a report.

-A structured step-by-step approach facilitates the production of a comprehensive
and informed literature review.
