drawing conclusions about writting a literature review. 

# Literature review 

The article Undertaking a literature review: a step-by-step approach (Patricia Cronin, 2008) outlines the importance of having 
a solid understanding of the research topic. It explains how having a comprehensive background knowledge to the study area allows
the researcher to be equipped with useful information for tackling the research question. Having a solid background understanding
of the topic not only helps the research, but the reader as well. The article also explains how conducting a literature review 
provides the reader with a comprehensive background for understanding current knowledge and highlighting the significance of new 
research. Beecroft et al (2006) argues conducting a literature review can help, depending on the projects progression, refine or 
focus a research question. This can also be applicable for the researcher to identifying knowledge gaps that 
demand further investigation or redefine their research focus if they encounter theoretical saturation on a topic.

Conducting a systematic literature review is argued for by Parahoo (2006), suggesting that a systematic review gives strict parameters
for selected literature and critics literature on its validity and relevance. This is to ensure the information gathered is as 
time-based relevant as possible. In response to this suggestion, this research project will aim to use only literature that is between
5-10 years old, with exceptions that the literature is of high significance for the research topic, and this will be assessed on a case
by case basis. Parahoo also explains how conducting a systematic literature review allows the researcher to identify similar work done 
within the area that may give helpful insight and findings that relate to the research question. Hek and Langton, (2000) detail how a 
systematic literature-review offers a structured way to compare previous findings and critique these with existing findings to suggest
further studies. This approach is likely to be the most beneficial in informing practice in future. The systematic-literature review 
will follow a short preview, question, read and summarization structure as explained by Cohen (1990). This approach keeps the review 
focused and consistent but ultimately facilitates easy identification and retrieval of material particularly if a large number of
publications are being reviewed.
