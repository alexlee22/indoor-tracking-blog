Last week in Cathy's class Research methods, each of us(Alex, Annisa and myself) all had a chance to do a presentation for our peers and some of the faculty staff at UNSW be. That was scary enough, but this week we are presenting to some big bosses at ARUP and BVN so our presentations need to be on point if we are going to stay in the game. 

### Some thoughts from the previous presentation include:

- Take my time/speak slowly
- My my presentation should be more dynamic(perhaps more animations/effects)
- Show more information: what will happen if I do not get the project to work as planned. 
- Talk more about they types of pilot experiments and research - what did and what didn't work along the way - inclusion and exclusion and evaluation.
