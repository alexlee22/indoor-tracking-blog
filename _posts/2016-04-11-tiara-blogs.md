A critical analysis of the ongoing experimentation of IndoorAtlas magnetic IPS 

# IndoorAtlas 

Check out: [IndoorAtlas](http://www.networkworld.com/article/2911467/internet-of-things/indoor-atlas-smartphones-can-navigate-inside-buildings-using-magnetic-fields.html)

### Claim 

Indoor atlas is capable of geolocation within a building with an SDK for iOS and Android, useing magnetometer data from your smartphone and cloud-based mapping data to locate a person to within 2 meters or less in real time.

### Aim

To test if IndoorAtlas can be used via smartphone (range of smartphones/compatibility) and beacon(wifi or bluetooth) and locate individuals/count, in real-time. 

### Findings

All test devices were checked for any missed up-dates
The program failed to download on anumber of smartphone devices including: LG iOS, windows tablet and ipod 6. 
program worked well on iphone 5 and measured accuretly 1-2 meter individuals within a small house floor plan in real time. 
No beacon could be linked to the software without full access to the source code/experimentation(still with no guarantee)
Still awaiting reply. 

### Further work

Continue trialling with beacons and smartphones, check usability within different building types: office spaces, malls, churches etc.
