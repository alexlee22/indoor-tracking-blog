description: some notes about conducting a semistructured interview

I consulted a few articles about writting a semi-structured interview and this is what I came up with as a summary. 

# Conducting a Semi-structured interview is hard. 

A semi-structured interviews with experts or practitioner maybe a viable method to fulfilling objective 4) and placing new leads in areas of research that have litter or no literature. Conducting a semi-structured interview allows the researcher a) to prepare questions ahead of time, b) to gather a wide variety of surrounding knowledge to the topic as well as potentially important information for future experimentation and c) allows some flexibility for the informants to express their views in their own terms. 
This form of Qualitative research according to Bernard (1988), is best used when “You won't get more than one chance to interview someone and when you will be sending several interviewers out into the field to collect data”, which maybe the case for this project. In addition, since they provide access to perceptions and opinions, they are effective for gaining insight into problems that are not immediately perceptible but that nonetheless cause concern in certain areas or in certain segments of the population. 
Adopted from the LAFOREST (2009), the interview format conducted during this part of the research project will be flexible and informal, however maintaining structure to conversation. The interviewer and respondents may engage in a majorly formal interview. The interviewer will develop a 'interview guide' (list of questions and topics that need to be covered during the conversation), in a particular order, (but not constrain by). The interviewer may follow the guide, but is allowed conversational flexibility from prepared topical trajectories when they feel this is appropriate. When sourcing who is interviewed, (Cohen D, 2008)describes appropriate interviewees as being “privileged witnesses, or people who, because of their position, activities or responsibilities have a good understanding of the problem to be explored”. Using open-ended questions is one technique described in (Anon., 2009)that allows the researcher to gather not only information attached to immediate questions, but help give answers to questions they may have in the future.
