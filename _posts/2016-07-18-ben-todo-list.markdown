So after a meeting with the team, we need to start thinking seriously about the implementation of this project. 

### Following up on Ben's todo list

### 1. Working out the layout of the base stations

The two files are located in the helpers file of this blog

As an example of the file:

![shitty rssi]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ BVN_basestation_locations.PNG) 

Planning to implement it into Ben's moving node system as well as integrate the grasshopper furniture boundaries within the plan as well by e.o.d tomorrow (fingers crossed)

### 2. Get results from existing experiments closed out

This I think has been done. I could review the experiments tomorrow and mark any that need to be repeated or written up differently. I will get the others to do the same. 

### 3. Work out a deployment plan

This we can do as a group. We have all agreed to spend 1 hour together tomorrow morning fleshing out our ideas for this. It will probably develop into a series of 3 phases. Stay tuned for more. 

4. Getting people on board with being tracked

This is more of a diplomatic thing and so It is best to leave it too the professionals like Matthew at BVN and BCW at ARUP. I can draw up a quite explanation of what we are going to do and a short brief statement from each of us saying what we hope to achieve with the data. This would allow people to think through the benefits of taking part in the experiment and become actively participatory within the experiments. 

### 5. Design of the base stations & 6. Design of the beacon

For now, this is a lot to do. so I think we will focus on the above before we head into 5 and 6 for now. I can mention the issue to Barry who is BVN's model maker. He might have a quick good solution for both, or might recommend a good strategy for getting the design made(possibly an office competition?). 


### 8 tips for international projects communications

1. Ensure that you and the remote worker are set up to achieve good lines of communication. 

2. Get the best technology tools available to you. 

3. Respond to emails quickly during office hours.

4. Avoid sarcasm in written communication.

5. Keep a clock on your desktop set to overseas time.

6. Keep an open mind when working with people from different nationalities.

7. Plan an assessment of the overseas relationship 1 to 2 times per year. 

8. Keep in touch with clients, customers & colleagues face-to-face via video.
